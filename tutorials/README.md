# Tutorials

This folder contains tutorials designed to equip you with the fundamental principles of designing and utilizing the functionality found inside our FSM equipped sensors.

Throughout these tutorials, you will explore key topics such as commands, Reset/Next conditions, timers, thresholds, masks, and interrupts.

By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to utilize the concepts covered here to create your own FSM configuration allowing you to generate interrupts based on your custom motion patterns.

## Tutorials overview

- [Tutorial 1 - Introduction to ST's Finite State Machine (FSM)](./1_introduction_to_STs_finite_state_machine/) - Learn how to use the FSM tool within MEMS Studio, improve your understanding of the UI and of the basic functionalities of the FSM.
- [Tutorial 2 - Temporary masks and Reset/Next coditions](./2_temporary_masks_and_reset_next_conditions/) - Expands on the previous tutorial by deepening your understanding of Temporary Masks and Reset/Next Conditions.
- [Tutorial 3 - Adaptive Self-Configuration feature](./3_adaptive_self_configuration_feature/) - Learn how to utilize the Adaptive Self-Configuration feature found in FSM 2.0 based devices.
- [Tutorial 4 - Utilizing MLC filters inside the FSM](./4_utilizing_MLC_filters_inside_the_FSM/) - Learn how to utilize the MLC preprocessing capabilities to add filters to the data used by the FSM.
- [Tutorial 5 - Integrating an MLC decision tree in FSM](./5_integrating_an_MLC_decision_tree_in_FSM/) - Learn how to configure the FSM to utilize the output value of a decision tree running in the MLC.
