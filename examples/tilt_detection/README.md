## Tilt detection
The tilt detection algorithm triggers an event when the inclination between the X-axis and the horizontal plane exceeds a specified angle.
This feature is widely used in industrial applications, gaming, and mobile devices to enable tilt-based interactions. Its ability to detect precise angular changes makes it a valuable tool for applications requiring orientation-based triggers.
