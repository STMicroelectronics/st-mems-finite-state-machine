## 1 - Introduction

Simple *jiggle* gesture (similar to a shake) example for wrist-worn devices. The gesture is detected when the accelerometer Z-axis is pointing up and the user is shaking the device along the Y-axis (accelerometer data filtered using the *Machine Learning Core*).

The configuration runs at 26 Hz.

For information on how to integrate this algorithm in the target platform, please follow the instructions available in the README file of the [examples](../../../examples) folder.

For information on how to create similar algorithms, please follow the instructions provided in the [tutorials](../../../tutorials) folder.

## 2 - Device orientation

ENU orientation is required.

## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.

## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the *jiggle* gesture is detected.
