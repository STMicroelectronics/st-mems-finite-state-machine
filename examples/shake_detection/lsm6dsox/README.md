## 1 - Introduction

Simple *shake* gesture example for smartphone devices. This gesture is detected when the user is shaking the accelerometer along the X-axis.

The configuration runs at 26 Hz.

For information on how to integrate this algorithm in the target platform, please follow the instructions available in the README file of the [examples](../../../examples) folder.

For information on how to create similar algorithms, please follow the instructions provided in the [tutorials](../../../tutorials) folder.

## 2 - Device orientation

ENU orientation is required.

## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.

## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the *shake* gesture is detected.
