## Flip-up detection
The flip-up detection algorithm recognizes the gesture of flipping a device upward when it is face-down on a table, often used to automatically turn on the device screen.
Configurable parameters include thresholds for face-down detection, flip-up detection, and associated timing.
This feature is ideal for mobile devices, enabling seamless interaction by reducing the need for manual screen activation. It improves user experience by providing an efficient and intuitive way to access the device.
