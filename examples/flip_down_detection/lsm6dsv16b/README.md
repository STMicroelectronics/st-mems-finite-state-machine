## 1 - Introduction

Simple *flip-down* gesture example, used to stop the phone-call by placing the accelerometer Z axis downward.

The configuration runs at 30 Hz.

For information on how to integrate this algorithm in the target platform, please follow the instructions available in the README file of the [examples](../../../examples) folder.

For information on how to create similar algorithms, please follow the instructions provided in the [tutorials](../../../tutorials) folder.

## 2 - Device orientation

ENU orientation is required.

## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.

## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the *flip-down* gesture is detected.
