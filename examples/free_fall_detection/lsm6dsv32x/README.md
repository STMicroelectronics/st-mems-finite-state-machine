## 1 - Introduction

Simple *free-fall* detection example, used to determine when the device is falling down. The examples uses the accelerometer sensor.

The configuration runs at 30 Hz.

For information on how to integrate this algorithm in the target platform, please follow the instructions available in the README file of the [examples](../../../examples) folder.

For information on how to create similar algorithms, please follow the instructions provided in the [tutorials](../../../tutorials) folder.

## 2 - Device orientation

Any orientation.

## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.

## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the *free-fall* is detected.
