## Motion-stationary detection
The motion/stationary detection algorithm classifies the state of a device as either in motion or stationary using accelerometer data.
This feature is widely applicable in fitness trackers, vehicle monitoring systems, and industrial equipment to track activity or inactivity. Its ability to provide real-time state classification enhances the functionality of devices that rely on motion-based data.
